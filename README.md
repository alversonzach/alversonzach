# Zachary Alverson SNHU CS 499 ePortfolio

Throughout my studies here at SNHU and developing this ePortfolio I have grown a tremendous amount in my ability to showcase my strengths and understanding of software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. This all started with developing small projects in IT 145 using the language Java. I gained a better understanding of data structures and algorithms in the course CS 260. Upon taking one of my favorite courses I learned about data structures and their purpose in DAD 220. I have also gained an important understanding and practice in collaborating in a team environment in CS 250, a course that focused on the SCRUM methodolgy. This also enhanced my knowledge of communicating to stakeholders by understanding how important it is to understand the requirments that must be met before starting devolopment. Specifically in this ePortfolio, I was able to showcase my proficiency in regards to programming in OOP, Java, NoSQL, MongoDB and Node.js.

The IT 145 course opened my eyes to OOP (object oriented programming). This enables you to create objects that can hold data and methods. This course was also an introduction to IDEs (integrated devolopment enviroments). This is an enviroment such as Microsoft Visual Code and Eclipse. This is where you can write and run your code using packages for different languages. This course introduced me to the basic sytax of Java and how an application should be designed.

In the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course I was able to grasp the importance of collaborating in a team environment. During that time, I was able to assume the role of, as well as work with others assuming the roles of different members of a SCRUM team. It was very interesting to take part in the discussions in different roles. These roles included the scrum master, product owner, tester, and developer. 

DAD 220 was a fasincating course and introduced me to the world of databases. This couse focused on SQL (Structered Query Language). SQL is used to gain access and modify data that is stored in databases. When I think about data being stored. I think of everything that is held on Amazon's application. All this data has to be accessedd, retrived, and manuipulated. This is one example of why understanding databases is so important.

For my ePortfolio, I decided to include three different artifacts â€“ one for each category that was incorporated. I chose to take one project and make three different enhancements in order to showcase my skills in software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms and databases. The artifacts that I included stem from a project that I worked on here at SNHU.

## [Original Java Program](https://github.com/alversonzach/alversonzach/blob/main/original.md)
This is the original program that I started with

## [Software Design and Engineering](https://github.com/alversonzach/alversonzach/blob/main/Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering.md)

A simple menu driven program to add, update, delete and show pets in an ArrayList

## [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/alversonzach/alversonzach/blob/main/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms.md)

An enhancement on the first artifact with the option to show the items from the ArrayList in alphabetical order and an option to print a ticket with different prices based on the user's input

## [Databases](https://github.com/alversonzach/alversonzach/blob/main/Databases.md)

The final enhancement is a web application with the same concepts as the Java apllication where the user can enter pet information and it is stored in a MongoDB database
